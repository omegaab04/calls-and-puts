# Pricing European Call and Put Options

In this project, I explore a fast way to price an option using the **Black-Scholes model**. 

The mathematics used here is written in **C** and wrapped in **Python** for user convenience.

```

#### For Windows

pip install setuptools wheel
```

### Clone Repo

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black-scholes.git
cd black-scholes
```
